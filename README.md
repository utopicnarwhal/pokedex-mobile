## About

This project is an exercise.

Exercise description:
```
Make an app that displays a list of all Pokemon’s which are able to fly.

You can use the following api for fetching the data https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/type/3/
Each list item is clickable and it will open info page of that Pokemon.
The user should be able to set and remove that Pokemon from favourites. If the list is updated or refetched, the app should remember that defined Pokemon.
Try to write high quality code like you would in a production environment.

Optional: 
* Use animations (for example, whenever the list will display, or favourite widget is pressed, transitions.
* Add some test cases if you have time.
```

The assignment is intended to last around 4h.
